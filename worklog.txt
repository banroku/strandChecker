180520  20:30-22:00 01:30
implemented movie2image.py
next: ok0032-ok0049 to ng
next: learn best format of training images

180521  5:00-6:30   03:00
runned movie2image.py to all movies 
next: categorize images to ok/ng
next: generate data from images

180522  5:30-6:30   03:30
categorized ok and ng images

180523  5:30-7:00   05:00
implemented separateCVfiles.py and separated cv to image_cv
next: ImageDataGenerator to fetch ok/ng data set

180524  4:30-6:30   07:00
downloaded classifier_from_little_data_script_2.py from github
cp it to strandChecker.py and modified to own setting
run it and fixed minor errors...
next: imput size and output size are not matched, to be fixed. 
most easy way: cut some files to make total nb equal to x4

180525  2:15-3:30   08:15
cut input samples to make total No equal to x4
ran top_model.fit first time and got ~97 acc. for cv. 
done error-checking: 
    train data - all 352 images matched to the label
    cv data - 1/88 image unmatched to the label (judge ng for ok)
        movie06_0030.bmp
        it has truely only has four strand!!
        strandChecker even found human labelling error ...

Next: real-time starndChecker from camera
      to validate its robustness. 
      (on rasberryPi if possible.)

180525  5:00-6:30   09:45
continuous predict from movie. 
acc rate not high... 
since using weight trained only in 10 epochs? 

Next: retrain model with 50 epochs and try again real-time strandcheck
Next: real-time standChecker from video cap

180528  5:00-6:00   10:45
tried different batch size in ImageDataGenerator. (16: ok, 32:freezed)
removed transpose of image in sc.realtimeCheck and got 97-100 acc on image06.mp4

Next: try real time check on extruder. 
Next: Move this system on raspi?

180601  4:30-5:00   11:15
validation check by new movie 'movie11' and 'movie12'. 
They showed several wrong prediction, 
while 'movie06' got almost 100% right prediction, 
indicating the over fitting of the model. 

Next: write brief report.
